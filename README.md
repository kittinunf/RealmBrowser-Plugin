## Why

Finding Realm File path can be such a pain, look at this [StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28465706/how-to-find-my-realm-file/28465803#28465803). Wouldn't be easier if there is a Plug-in that does this for you automatically?

## Requirements

Xcode 6.0+ on OS X 10.10+.

## Installation

### Manual 

* Download latest version [here](https://github.com/kittinunf/RealmBrowser-Plugin/releases/latest).
* Unzip and copy into plug-in location `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`.

### Alcatraz

## How to use

* Leave your Simulator running, and make sure that your awesome App that uses Realm was installed in there.

* Tada! Enjoy your Realm browser with your Realm file without manually finding right Realm path.
